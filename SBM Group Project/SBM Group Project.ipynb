In 2024, mobile applications are estimated to generate over \\$900 billion in revenue [@global2019]. Generally, mobile applications ('*apps*' from here on) tend to be categorized in three different categories [@roma2016]. Paid apps are the most transparent; they revenue is based on an up-front purchase by the user. Free apps, on the other hand, require no purchase by the user at any stage. According to @roma2016, these apps make their revenue from deals with third-parties, either through advertisement or other purposes such as market information.\n",

Of these three revenue models, freemium is the most commonly used and the most [@salehudin2021] and leads to more downloads as well as revenue [@liu2014].\n",

        "Currently, most apps utilize the freemium revenue model [@salehudin2021]. However, as discussed in @djaruma2023, there are many revenue models between completely premium and completely free. A more fine-grained classification of app revenue models beyond the traditional \"paid-freemium-free\" framework holds significant societal and business implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "For society, such distinctions enhance transparency. Some monetization models, such as free or ad-filled apps, may rely on selling user information as a source of revenue [@bamberger2020]. Therefore, clearer distinctions regarding the revenue model will empower consumers to make informed choices. It may also enable policymakers to identify and regulate exploitative practices, such as manipulative microtransactions or intrusive ad models, ensuring all applications align with ethical and legal standards [@mileros2024].\n",
        "\n",
        "For businesses, this paper should unlock more insight into the effectiveness of different revenue streams. This will allow developers to tailor monetization strategies to specific audiences.

        "To answer the question \"*How are the 5 different revenue models as proposed by @djaruma2023 correlate to the success of an app?*\", we must first define what constitutes to success. In this paper, success will be defined by a couple of factors: popularity, rating, and estimated revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Popularity {#sec-popularity}\n",
        "\n",
        "The popularity of an app can be measured by the number of downloads. It is important to note the popularity of an app is complex, and is not solely dependent on the chosen revenue model. Other features, such as whether an app is featured on charts, whether it has frequent updates, and word-of-mouth awareness, will also impact the popularity of an app [@aydingokgoz2021]. However, despite these other variables, to versions of the same app will still have drastically different performances with different revenue streams [@liu2014].\n",
        "\n",
        "H1a: Apps that allow the user to have free access to all features (level 0 and 1) will have the highest amount of downloads overall. However, the ratings may fluctuate, as quality can vary for free-to-access apps. <!-- Is citation hier nodig? -->\n",
        "\n",
        "H1b: The apps with the most downloads will be level 1. Most social media platforms, which dominate our culture, tend to have this revenue stream [@djaruma2023].\n",
        "\n",
        "H1c: For apps that utilize a sample and a premium version of the same app (level 2), the free versions of an app will have more downloads than their paid-for counterpart. Most, if not all, users will download the free version first, and then might upgrade. This means there should be a disparity between the number of downloads between the apps, as is also demonstrated by @liu2012freemium.\n",
        "\n",
        "H1d: The most downloaded apps in the gaming category will likely fall under level 4. Many popular games use this type of \"pay-to-win\" mechanism [@nieborg2016]. Therefore, it would be expected this same pattern would arise from our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rating {#sec-rating}\n",
        "\n",
        "The downloads of an app are not everything. An app can be downloaded often, but may not be highly rated.\n",
        "\n",
        "H2a: Apps that require the user to pay to unlock features (level 2, 3, and 4) will tend to have lower ratings than the version that requires payment upfront (level 5). The main draw of a freemium model is to attract users, and have them update to a paid version [@kumar2014]. However, as @kumar2014 points out, this can be a double-edged sword. Too few features, and it may not be attractive to users. Too many features, and the users will not update.\n",
        "\n",
        "H2b: Fully premium apps (level 5) will have less variance in their ratings, while all other levels will have more. In the same vein as H2a, users have more realistic expectations of paid apps compared to apps that require you to unlock features [@kumar2014]. Therefore, more users downloading premium apps will be satisfied with their purchase, leading to less variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "H3: For apps that utilize a sample and a premium version of the same app (level 2), the rating of the paid-for version is positively associated with the rating of the free version of the same app. This was true for the study on the most popular apps in the Google Play Store by @liu2012freemium, so it is expected a similar pattern should arise for this dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to point out downloads and ratings likely do not directly correlate to the actual revenue of an app. The revenue of apps \"premium\" apps that require an upfront payment, the revenue is relatively simple to track and compare. However, for apps that rely on advertisement, in-app purchases and/or selling market information, this is harder to track.\n",
        "\n",
        "For apps that solely on advertisement, time retention can be a good measure of revenue [@ross2018]. However, this only works if the app solely relies on ads. An example of this given by @djaruma2023 is TikTok: this app relies not only on advertisement, but also on users purchasing products through its shop. Therefore, using solely the time retention would not accurately capture the revenue of an app with both revenue streams. Furthermore, the selling of user data is usually not publicized, meaning it is not possible to know the revenue from this.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, our data only contains the price of \"premium\" app versions. The data does not include any details regarding in-app purchases nor time-retention. Because of this lack of sufficient data, solely downloads and ratings will be taken into account as indicators of success.\n",

For the purpose of our analysis, 13 variables were selected, capturing critical information about app characteristics, user engagement, monetization strategies, and developer details. These variables include the app's unique identifier (my_app_id), the total number of downloads (num_downloads), average user ratings (rating_app), and the number of ratings (nb_rating). Additionally, the dataset provides information on app pricing (price_gplay), the presence of in-app purchases (in_app), and whether the app includes advertisements (has_ads). Other variables, such as content ratings (content_rating_app), app categories (categ_app), and developer information (developer_name and developer_info), further enhance the richness of the dataset. This subset of variables allows us to comprehensively examine the interplay between monetization strategies and app success.\n",
        "\n",
        "To systematically explore monetization strategies, we classified the apps into six distinct levels based on their monetization models. These levels reflect varying approaches to generating revenue, ranging from completely free apps to fully premium paid apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Level 0 represents apps with no monetization, offering free services without ads or in-app purchases. At the opposite end, Level 5 includes premium apps requiring upfront payment, free from ads or in-app purchases, delivering a premium experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "In between, Level 1 consists of free apps monetized solely through ads, while Level 3 combines ads and in-app purchases, offering additional features for users willing to pay. Level 4 refines the freemium model by removing ads and relying entirely on in-app purchases to monetize.\n",
        "\n",
        "Level 2 employs a dual-version strategy, featuring both free sample apps with limited functionality (and potentially ads) and paid premium apps with comprehensive features and no ads or in-app purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "This classification is grounded in theoretical frameworks, such as the monetization levels proposed by Djaruma et al. (2023) and the App business models of (CITE), and allows for a nuanced analysis of how different revenue models impact app success metrics like user ratings and downloads. Our systematic categorization facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between monetization strategies and app performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Statistical Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "To test our hypotheses, we employed a combination of descriptive statistics, text processing, and machine learning techniques. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze distributions and trends in metrics such as num_downloads, rating_app, and price_gplay. We categorized applications into six monetization levels based on binary indicators: is_free, in_app, and has_ads. Price values were processed to distinguish between free and paid applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify paired sample and premium applications within level 2, we applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization combined with cosine similarity on application names. This approach is effective for measuring textual similarity between documents (CITE Source 2). Subsequent filtering involved prefix matching and the identification of indicative terms (e.g., \"Free,\" \"Pro\") to ensure logical pairing based on naming conventions and shared developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To adjust ratings for applications with few reviews, we calculated a Bayesian average. This method provides a more robust measure of user satisfaction by accounting for the number of ratings and the overall average rating across all applications (CITE Source 3). Visualizations, including scatter plots and box plots, were employed to explore relationships between monetization levels and user engagement metrics which will be displayed in the results section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Handeling of Assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "We addressed missing values by removing rows with critical nulls, such as those in num_downloads, to maintain data integrity. Text-based variables like content_rating_app were standardized to ensure consistency. For price_gplay, currency symbols were removed to facilitate the classification of applications into free or paid categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outliers in metrics like num_downloads were retained if they represented industry-leading applications, as their exclusion could skew the analysis. The use of Bayesian averages mitigated bias in rating_app due to low review counts, providing a more accurate reflection of user satisfaction. Covariance checks were conducted to ensure the absence of multicollinearity among numerical variables, thereby enhancing the reliability of correlation and regression analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some applications exhibited rare combinations of is_free, in_app, and has_ads that did not fit within the predefined monetization levels. These applications were excluded from the analysis but documented as a limitation. Edge cases in level 2 application pairing were flagged for potential mismatches due to naming ambiguities, ensuring transparency in the classification process.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methodologies facilitated a systematic and accurate exploration of monetization models and their impact on application performance.\n",

        "It can be concluded that indeed the most downloaded apps fall under level 1 (see @fig-total-average-downloads-by-level-1). But this requires a nuanced view, since 50% of the apps fall under level 1 (see @fig-distribution-amount-apps-levels) and it has a relatively low average among other levels (see @fig-total-average-downloads-by-level-2). So, it requires further analysis to understand the popularity of level 1. As seen from @fig-distribution-app-downloads it shows that there is high inequality, resulting in a small proportion of the apps accounting to a majority of the downloads. Furthermore, @fig-num-downloads-by-level-log shows that apps in level 1 are considered among the top downloaded apps. In particular, the categories under which social media platform fall (see @fig-num-downloads-1-billion). Looking at the apps provided by @djaruma2023, it can be concluded that there is enough evidence to support h1b (see @tbl-top-8-apps-paper).\n",
