With the every-growing popularity of cellphones [@charted2023], the popularity of mobile applications is also steadily increasing. In 2024, mobile applications are estimated to generate over \$900 billion in revenue [@global2019]. Generally, mobile applications ('*apps*' from here on) tend to be categorized in three different categories [@roma2016]. Paid apps are the most transparent; they revenue is based on an up-front purchase by the user. Free apps, on the other hand, require no purchase by the user at any stage. According to @roma2016, these apps make their revenue from deals with third-parties, either through advertisement or other purposes such as market information.

Finally, freemium apps are, as the name suggests, a middle-ground between free and premium. Users get access to a basic version of the application first and can unlock more features through an in-app payment [@kumar2014]. Of these three revenue models, freemium is the most commonly used and the most [@salehudin2021] and leads to more downloads as well as revenue [@liu2014].

## Academic Background

<!-- Kort samengevat: Wat is de wetenschappelijke consensus over dit topic? Dit wordt verder uitgediept in de Theory and Hypothesis sectie.-->

Most research uses these three established categories—paid, freemium, and free—when discussing revenue models for apps. However, by limiting the discussion to these three terms, nuances within these categories might be missed.

In a review paper from 2023 [@djaruma2023], different levels of monetization are suggested based on previous literature. These levels provide a clear framework for the revenue models of mobile apps.

| Strategy | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Level 5: Premium | Pay to use the application. This either happens up-front, or after a trial period. |
| Level 4: Semi-premium | Use a limited number of features for free. Unlock the app with all features through an in-app purchase. |
| Level 3: In-app advertisement and in-app purchases | Free application with ads, encouraging users to remove ads or to make in-app purchases. |
| Level 2: Sample and premium | Two different versions of the same app. One is a version with limit features and/or ads. The other version is a premium version. |
| Level 1: In-app advertisement | Only one version of the app, with only ads and no in-app purchases. |
| Level 0: Free | The app has no monetization. However, money can still be made through selling user information. |

: Six levels of monetization for apps

<!-- Ik heb dit expres kort gehouden, aangezien we ook nog een uitgebreidere literatuur review hebben. Maar, misschien moet dit toch nog iets langer? -Noa -->

## Societal Background

<!-- Is there any tie to practical contexts? How is this relevant to current business practices? -->

Currently, most apps utilize the freemium revenue model [@salehudin2021]. However, as discussed in @djaruma2023, there are many revenue models between completely premium and completely free. A more fine-grained classification of app revenue models beyond the traditional "paid-freemium-free" framework holds significant societal and business implications.

For society, such distinctions enhance transparency. Some monetization models, such as free or ad-filled apps, may rely on selling user information as a source of revenue [@bamberger2020]. Therefore, clearer distinctions regarding the revenue model will empower consumers to make informed choices. It may also enable policymakers to identify and regulate exploitative practices, such as manipulative microtransactions or intrusive ad models, ensuring all applications align with ethical and legal standards [@mileros2024].

For businesses, this paper should unlock more insight into the effectiveness of different revenue streams. This will allow developers to tailor monetization strategies to specific audiences. Furthermore, both consumers and regulatory bodies are growing more concerned with the privacy concerns of apps, especially ones that rely on market information [@mileros2024]. A granular understanding helps businesses adapt, aligning profitability with sustainability and ethical considerations.

## Research Gap

<!-- Kort samengevat: Wat is de relevantie? -->

In short, apps play an increasingly important role in our techno-centric society. To improve the user experience and increase profits, consideration of revenue models is key. Despite the great depth of research on this topic, literature tends to be focussed on the three big categories of paid, freemium, and free. This lack of nuance prevents us from understanding the fine-grained details that may help improve future apps.

<!-- Wat is de research gap? En wat is dus de onderzoekvraag? -->

The levels of monetization as proposed by @djaruma2023 would allow for this nuance. However, their framework has never been used in an empirical setting, as the paper by @djaruma2023 was published only last year. Applying this framework to see how different revenue streams impact the popularity of an app may yield valuable insights into the preferences of consumers. Therefore, the question to answer within this paper will be: *How are the 5 different revenue models as proposed by @djaruma2023 correlated to the success of an app?*

In this section, prior research into the topic of revenue streams and its correlation to success in apps will be discussed. As mentioned in the Introduction section, this paper will apply the 5 levels of revenue as proposed by @djaruma2023 to app data. The following section will contain a holistic overview of the existing research, as well as hypotheses that arise from this theoretical framework.

## Literature Review

To answer the question "*How are the 5 different revenue models as proposed by @djaruma2023 correlate to the success of an app?*", we must first define what constitutes to success. In this paper, success will be defined by a couple of factors: popularity, rating, and estimated revenue.

### Popularity

The popularity of an app can be measured by the number of downloads. It is important to note the popularity of an app is complex, and is not solely dependent on the chosen revenue model. Other features, such as whether an app is featured on charts, whether it has frequent updates, and word-of-mouth awareness, will also impact the popularity of an app [@aydingokgoz2021]. However, despite these other variables, to versions of the same app will still have drastically different performances with different revenue streams [@liu2014].

H1a: Apps that allow the user to have free access to all features (level 0 and 1) will have the highest amount of downloads overall. However, the ratings may fluctuate, as quality can vary for free-to-access apps. <!-- Is citation hier nodig? -->

H1b: The apps with the most downloads will be level 1. Most social media platforms, which dominate our culture, tend to have this revenue stream [@djaruma2023].

H1c: For apps that utilize a sample and a premium version of the same app (level 2), the free versions of an app will have more downloads than their paid-for counterpart. Most, if not all, users will download the free version first, and then might upgrade. This means there should be a disparity between the number of downloads between the apps, as is also demonstrated by @liu2012freemium.

H1d: The most downloaded apps in the gaming category will likely fall under level 4. Many popular games use this type of "pay-to-win" mechanism [@nieborg2016]. Therefore, it would be expected this same pattern would arise from our data.

### Rating

The downloads of an app are not everything. An app can be downloaded often, but may not be highly rated.

H2a: Apps that require the user to pay to unlock features (level 2, 3, and 4) will tend to have lower ratings than the version that requires payment upfront (level 5). The main draw of a freemium model is to attract users, and have them update to a paid version [@kumar2014]. However, as @kumar2014 points out, this can be a double-edged sword. Too few features, and it may not be attractive to users. Too many features, and the users will not update.

H2b: Fully premium apps (level 5) will have less variance in their ratings, while all other levels will have more. In the same vein as H2a, users have more realistic expectations of paid apps compared to apps that require you to unlock features [@kumar2014]. Therefore, more users downloading premium apps will be satisfied with their purchase, leading to less variance.

H3: For apps that utilize a sample and a premium version of the same app (level 2), the rating of the paid-for version is positively associated with the rating of the free version of the same app. This was true for the study on the most popular apps in the Google Play Store by @liu2012freemium, so it is expected a similar pattern should arise for this dataset.

### Revenue Estimation

<!-- Dit stuk kan later ook nog verschoven worden naar de discussie als dat beter is voor de flow. -Noa -->

It is important to point out downloads and ratings likely do not directly correlate to the actual revenue of an app. The revenue of apps "premium" apps that require an upfront payment, the revenue is relatively simple to track and compare. However, for apps that rely on advertisement, in-app purchases and/or selling market information, this is harder to track.

For apps that solely on advertisement, time retention can be a good measure of revenue [@ross2018]. However, this only works if the app solely relies on ads. An example of this given by @djaruma2023 is TikTok: this app relies not only on advertisement, but also on users purchasing products through its shop. Therefore, using solely the time retention would not accurately capture the revenue of an app with both revenue streams. Furthermore, the selling of user data is usually not publicized, meaning it is not possible to know the revenue from this.

Unfortunately, our data only contains the price of "premium" app versions. The data does not include any details regarding in-app purchases nor time-retention. Because of this lack of sufficient data, solely downloads and ratings will be taken into account as indicators of success.

In this section, we will discuss the dataset and methods used to test the hypotheses outlined in the previous section. The focus lies on providing a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its structure and the variables it contains, followed by an explanation of the variable selection process. Additionally, we outline the statistical methods applied and discuss how assumptions, such as missing values and potential biases, were addressed to ensure the robustness of our analysis.

## Dataset Description

<!--Omschrijf de data: hoeveel instances, welke variables, waar gaat de data over?-->

The dataset used for this research consists of 1,016,666 instances and 27 variables, representing a detailed overview of mobile applications across various revenue models. Each instance corresponds to an app, and the variables capture key attributes such as app downloads, user ratings, and monetization strategies. Below is an overview of some of variables:

| Variable | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| my_app_id (object) | Unique identifier for each app. |
| date_published (object) | The publication date of the app. Only three missing values (0.000295% null). |
| privacy_policy (object) | Information about the app's privacy policy, missing in 28.57% of cases. |
| rating_app (float64) | The average rating of the app, with 8.76% missing values. |
| nb_rating (object) | Number of ratings received by the app, missing in 8.76% of cases. |
| num_downloads (object) | The number of downloads for the app, nearly complete with only 15 missing values (0.001475% null). |
| price_gplay (object) | The price of the app as listed on Google Play, missing in 0.43% of cases. |
| in_app (bool) | Indicates whether the app has in-app purchases (no missing values). |
| has_ads (bool) | Indicates whether the app contains advertisements (no missing values). |
| content_rating_app (object) | The app's content rating, with three missing values (0.000295% null). |
| developer_name (object) | The name of the app developer, missing in only 16 instances (0.001574% null). |

The dataset includes several additional variables related to app features, developer information, and user engagement metrics such as visit_website, more_from_developer, and family_library. However, some variables, such as whats_new (100% null) and in_app_product (89.57% null), were deemed unsuitable for analysis due to their high proportion of missing data.

The primary purpose of this dataset in this study, is to analyze app monetization strategies by categorizing apps into distinct revenue levels and evaluating their performance based on key metrics like downloads and user ratings.

## Variable Selection

```{=html}
<!-- Welke variabelen gebruiken wij? Welke hebben we eruit gehaald? (Hierover uitbreiden in Handeling of Assumptions).

Hoe definiëren we de 5 levels?-->
```

The dataset utilized in this study consists of 1,016,666 entries, encompassing a broad range of attributes related to mobile applications. For the purpose of our analysis, 13 variables were selected, capturing critical information about app characteristics, user engagement, monetization strategies, and developer details. These variables include the app's unique identifier (my_app_id), the total number of downloads (num_downloads), average user ratings (rating_app), and the number of ratings (nb_rating). Additionally, the dataset provides information on app pricing (price_gplay), the presence of in-app purchases (in_app), and whether the app includes advertisements (has_ads). Other variables, such as content ratings (content_rating_app), app categories (categ_app), and developer information (developer_name and developer_info), further enhance the richness of the dataset. This subset of variables allows us to comprehensively examine the interplay between monetization strategies and app success.

To systematically explore monetization strategies, we classified the apps into six distinct levels based on their monetization models. These levels reflect varying approaches to generating revenue, ranging from completely free apps to fully premium paid apps.

Level 0 represents apps with no monetization, offering free services without ads or in-app purchases. At the opposite end, Level 5 includes premium apps requiring upfront payment, free from ads or in-app purchases, delivering a premium experience.

In between, Level 1 consists of free apps monetized solely through ads, while Level 3 combines ads and in-app purchases, offering additional features for users willing to pay. Level 4 refines the freemium model by removing ads and relying entirely on in-app purchases to monetize.

Level 2 employs a dual-version strategy, featuring both free sample apps with limited functionality (and potentially ads) and paid premium apps with comprehensive features and no ads or in-app purchases.

This classification is grounded in theoretical frameworks, such as the monetization levels proposed by Djaruma et al. (2023) and the App business models of (CITE), and allows for a nuanced analysis of how different revenue models impact app success metrics like user ratings and downloads. Our systematic categorization facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between monetization strategies and app performance.

## Statistical Methods

To test our hypotheses, we employed a combination of descriptive statistics, text processing, and machine learning techniques. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze distributions and trends in metrics such as num_downloads, rating_app, and price_gplay. We categorized applications into six monetization levels based on binary indicators: is_free, in_app, and has_ads. Price values were processed to distinguish between free and paid applications.

To identify paired sample and premium applications within level 2, we applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization combined with cosine similarity on application names. This approach is effective for measuring textual similarity between documents (CITE Source 2). Subsequent filtering involved prefix matching and the identification of indicative terms (e.g., "Free," "Pro") to ensure logical pairing based on naming conventions and shared developers.

To adjust ratings for applications with few reviews, we calculated a Bayesian average. This method provides a more robust measure of user satisfaction by accounting for the number of ratings and the overall average rating across all applications (CITE Source 3). Visualizations, including scatter plots and box plots, were employed to explore relationships between monetization levels and user engagement metrics which will be displayed in the results section.

### Handeling of Assumptions

We addressed missing values by removing rows with critical nulls, such as those in num_downloads, to maintain data integrity. Text-based variables like content_rating_app were standardized to ensure consistency. For price_gplay, currency symbols were removed to facilitate the classification of applications into free or paid categories.

Outliers in metrics like num_downloads were retained if they represented industry-leading applications, as their exclusion could skew the analysis. The use of Bayesian averages mitigated bias in rating_app due to low review counts, providing a more accurate reflection of user satisfaction. Covariance checks were conducted to ensure the absence of multicollinearity among numerical variables, thereby enhancing the reliability of correlation and regression analyses.

Some applications exhibited rare combinations of is_free, in_app, and has_ads that did not fit within the predefined monetization levels. These applications were excluded from the analysis but documented as a limitation. Edge cases in level 2 application pairing were flagged for potential mismatches due to naming ambiguities, ensuring transparency in the classification process.

These methodologies facilitated a systematic and accurate exploration of monetization models and their impact on application performance.

## Reflection on the Findings

Downloads do not necessarily indicate revenue for freemium models [@djaruma2023]. The time the user spends on an app and the purchases made within this app [@ross2018] are better measures of the revenue for freemium applications.
