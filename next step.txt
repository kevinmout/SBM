Topic 2: Freemium vs Paid-For Apps
1. Classify apps into “freemium,” “free,” and “paid”. --> Use in_app and price_gplay
2. Examine their impact on num_downloads, rating_app, and nb_rating to assess engagement. 
3. Further analyze SDK usage (sdk_type, sdk_name) across these categories to see if there are specific SDKs (e.g., analytics or ad SDKs) that are more common in freemium vs. paid apps.


Topic 3: SDK Evolution and App LifeCycle
1. How many downloads before and after sdk activation?
